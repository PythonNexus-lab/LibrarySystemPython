# Library Management System (Python + SQLite)

This is a simple Library Management System built using **Python** and **SQLite** as part of a group project for Session 14 in our Database course.

## Project Goals

- Practice working with DDL and DML in SQL
- Create 5 master data tables with primary and foreign keys
- Demonstrate the use of SQL operations: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `REPLACE`, `TRUNCATE`
- Use Python to interact with a relational database

## Tables Used

1. `Authors` – Stores author information
2. `Books` – Contains book records linked to authors
3. `Members` – Library members (borrowers)
4. `Staff` – Staff members (admin, librarian, etc.)
5. `Loans` – Tracks book borrowings by members

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- SQLite (via `sqlite3` module)
- VS Code
- DB Browser for SQLite

##  Features Demonstrated

- `CREATE TABLE` statements with constraints
- `INSERT OR IGNORE` to avoid duplicates
- `UPDATE` member data
- `REPLACE` book info
- Simulated `TRUNCATE` using `DELETE FROM`
- Table relationships via foreign keys
